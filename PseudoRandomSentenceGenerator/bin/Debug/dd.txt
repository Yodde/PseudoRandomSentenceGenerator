We will use Markov chains to solve this problem. In short, a Markov chain is a stochastic process with the Markov property. 
By this property the changes of state of the system depend only on the current state of the system, and not additionally on the state of the system at previous steps.
I’ve been interested for a long time in generating “random” texts using a given corpus. A naive way is to take words randomly and drop them together but it would result in an unreadable text.
